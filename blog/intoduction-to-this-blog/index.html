    <h1>Introduction to this blog</h1>
    <p><small>11 February 2024</small></p>
    <p>
      This Blog is mainly aimed for me to improve my understanding and knowledge about the topics I write about. Those
      can either be
      about video games, programming, computer science, linguistics and archaeology. And I hope that
      <strong>you</strong> as a reader of this blog will <em>enjoy the articles</em> that I will publish here.
    </p>
    <h2>How I made this blog:</h2>
    <p>
      This below is just something akin to an FAQ. These are informations about the process, the thoughts and the
      technology that helped me create this blog:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Articles:</strong> I have many different interests, but I try to vary my selection of themes. I can not
      guarantee a fair selection, as this blog is mainly aimed at
      myself and improving my skills in writing, may it be about some
      (boring) things about <em>archaeology</em> or <em>programming</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Design:</strong> I aimed to make a blog more akin to the idea of the
      <q><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">small web</a></q> by
      <a href="https://benhoyt.com/">Ben Hoyt</a>. Furthermore I added <code>dark</code> and <code>light</code> modes,
      mainly because I personally prefer when a website changes colour according to the prefered mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technology:</strong> I am using for this blog just <em>plain old HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> and
      (currently) <em>no JavaScript</em>. Furthermore as I try to go for simplicity, there aren't any cookies.
      Additionally as there is no interactivity on this blog (at least for now), so the need to implement JavaScript or
      Cookies is not existing.
