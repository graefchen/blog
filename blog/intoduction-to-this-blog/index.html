    <h1>Introduction to this blog</h1>
    <p><small>11. February 2024</small></p>
    <p>So... Writing an Introduction to a Blog is way harder than I expected it to be... But here it comes:</p>
    <p>This Blog is mainly aimed for me to better my understanding and knowledge of certain topics. Those can either be
      about video games, programming, computer science, linguistics, archaeology and any other interesting tidbits that
      I find. And I hope that <strong>you</strong> as a reader of this blog will <em>enjoy the articles</em> that
      I will publish here.
    </p>
    <p>As someone might be interested in how this website might have been made, I am writing some parts of the process
      and thoughts down below:</p>
    <p><strong>Design:</strong> I aimed to make a blog more akin to the idea of the
      <q><a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/">small web</a></q> by
      <a href="https://benhoyt.com/">Ben Hoyt</a>. Furthermore I added <code>dark</code> and <code>light</code> modes,
      mainly because I personally prefer when a website changes its colour according to the visitors preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Articles:</strong> I have many different interests as mentioned above. So I try to vary my selection of
      articles. I will not guarantee a fair selection, as this blog is mainly aimed at
      myself and improving my skills in writing and understanding the subject I am writing about, may it be about some
      (boring) things about <em>archaeology</em>, some cool <em>technical topics</em> or simply a <em>rant</em>.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Technology:</strong> I am using for this blog just <em>plain old HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> and (currently)
      <em>no JavaScript</em>. This is very simple and works for me and the current scope this blog is in. Furthermore I
      do not use any cookies. For the use-case of this blog I do not see a very good reason why I should use blogs.
      There is no interactivity on this blog (at least for now).
    </p>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my first blog post. I hope to see you around.</p>
