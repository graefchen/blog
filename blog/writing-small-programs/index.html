    <h1>Writing small programs</h1>
    <p><small>08 March 2024</small></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I like writing small programs, that means, programs that do one thing and this thing well, while not having a
        large code base and that aren't build on many dependencies.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>
      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>Before we start, we must clarify how to define small programs, or at least how I define them. For me small
      programs hasn't a large codebase. Optionally it is just one file big with preferably under 100 lines.</p>
    <p>At maximum the codebase should have 1000 lines of code. The exception are dependencies.
      Additionally the program could have been written in a small amount of time, but this is not strictly necessary in
      my opinion.</p>
    <p>A <em>hack</em> to get away with writing small programs is creating an (one-file) library that you add as an
      dependency that helps you with making programs smaller, especially when writing duplicate code.</p>
    <h2>
      An example
    </h2>
    <p>
      To better clarify what I mean I share the following 13 line code:
    </p>
    <pre>
#SingleInstance Force

; AltGr + y
<^>!y::
{
  SendText "»"
}

; AltGr + x
<^>!x::
{
  SendText "«"
}
</pre>
    <p>Here I am using <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com">AutoHotkey</a> to create a small program that enables me to
      use
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet">Guillemet</a> on my German keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>Writing small programs can be challenging and fun and a you should try to do it at least once.</p>
