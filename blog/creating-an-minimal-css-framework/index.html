        I assume you as the reader came to this website to create your own minimal CSS, so I will show you how and what
        to do. I expect that you have a certain basic understanding of CSS and are able to look up concepts you do not
        understand.

    <h2 id="project-plan">Project Plan</h2>
    <p>
      The project plan is to create an minimal CSS framework. For that we firstly create an reset, then normalize some
      elements and then add our own style over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To let our framework be as minimal as possible, we will not add classes and id's (besides that using id's for
      frameworks is not an great idea), and we will stay with and simple classsless framework (a framework that only
      uses semantic html without adding classes).
    </p>
    <p>
      We will mainly focus on following elements to make the framework fairly simple and small:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>:root</li>
      <li>*</li>
      <li>body</li>
      <li>main</li>
      <li>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</li>
      <li>p, li</li>
      <li>ol, ul</li>
      <li>a</li>
      <li>pre, blockquote</li>
      <li>img</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because this limited set of featured elements will not be enough for most framework. I will leave further
      extensions to the reader. Additionally I will give you further resources that might help adding or doing things in
      a complete different way than I have done.
    </p>
    <h2 id="css-reset">CSS Reset</h2>
    <h3>A very basic implementation</h3>
    <p>
      The most important step to take when creating a new CSS framework is to reset the browsers default CSS settings.
      There are multiple ways to do this, but my personal preference is:
    </p>
    <pre>
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Additional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Why do we do this exactly?</h4>
        <p>
          There are multiple reasons but the main reason is that most browsers have
          default CSS styles that adds an margin on the <code>body</code> element.<br>
          The most important part is the <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>. The reason is that it will ensure a good
          consistency and predictability for the sizing of elements. Mainly because a border will stay
          in the width and height of an element (see
          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing">Mozilla Web Docs</a>).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      This reset is very minimal, but has quite a big of problems, that we can fix later or we use a very similar
      approach that does not add styling to elements that we do not want to change.</p>
    <h3>An alternative minimal approach</h3>
    <pre>
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ol, li {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Additional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Why is this approach better?</h4>
        <p>
          Again there are multiple reasons for it, but the most important is that the <code>*</code> selector selects
          every element in a website. So our second implementation only selects the elements we want to select to not
          cause issues we can avoid.
        </p>
        <h4>Further Tips:</h4>
        <p>
          We could remove the <code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code> selectors if we want
          to keep the default padding for the lists.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      This approach is less extreme but gives most of the benifits of the first version without adding as many
      drawbacks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="normalizing">Normalizing</h2>
    <p>
      While normalizing and resetting are generally understood to be the same thing, I do prefer to
      differentiate between these two. That is because I understand the reset to encapsulate multiple different or (as
      in our first implementation) all elements of a webpage that do not directly share a different function, for
      example an paragraph (<code>p</code>) and an image (<code>img</code>).
    </p>
    <h3>Dark and Light mode</h3>
    <p>
      But before we can style furter we need to go on a small tangent on light and dark mode, especially as CSS has
      features to change the mode depending on the settings of the device you use to visit a website.
    </p>
    <p>This would look like:</p>
    <pre>
:root {
  color-scheme: light;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
}
</pre>
    <p>
      This code will use the default light and dark mode style. It is a very small hack for now but we will change it
      <a href="#adding-color">later</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Font and Body</h3>
    <p>
      So lets start to add our minimal styling with the <code>body</code> tag:
    </p>
    <pre>
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: min(65ch, 90%);
  line-height: 1.4;
}
</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Additional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Another font-family</h4>
        <p>
          While we use a very very long font-family selection. This will absolutely guarantes that a sans-serif font
          will be rendered, prefereably the font the device, that is visiting our website, is using.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      This ensures the size of the font is the same on every browser we use, prefereably the font of the system, while
      also guaranteeing that if the sytem-ui is not given there exist an fallback, ending with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif">sans-serif</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore it centers everything in the <code>body</code> element and gives the body a certain width that is
      fixed to <em>65 characters</em> on devices with a large width and to <em>90%</em> on devices with a width
      that is smaller than the <em>65 characters</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally everything will now be centered in the middle of the website using our framework. And with the line
      height set to 1.4, there will be enought room between each line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lets continue with font settings:
    </p>
    <pre>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}

p, li {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}
</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Additional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Problems with <code>balance</code> and <code>pretty</code>.</h4>
        <p>
          <code>balance</code> and <code>pretty</code> have both the problem of being computably expansive. Balance has
          therefor a limit of 5 or 10 lines, depending on the browser the device is using (see
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap">Mozilla Web Doc</a>).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      Sadly because <code>text-wrap</code> is fairly new, not all browsers support it.
      None the less it is still very helpful to have them, as they help your text to look decent without much work.
      This means that there will be <strong>no orphaned word</strong> (one word in the last wrapped around line of an
      paragarph) with <em>pretty</em> and that with <em>balance</em> the text <strong>looks uniform</strong>
      when it wraps over multiple lines.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding margin back</h3>
    <p>
      Because we have removed every margin, the website looks a little squished. So we reintruduce a margin with the
      fllowing code:
    </p>
    <pre>
main > * {
  margin-bottom: 0.75rem;
}
</pre>
    <p>
      This line of code ensures that <strong>every</strong> direct child element of <code>main</code> will have an
      bottom margin of 75% of the root elements size, which is the <code>font-size</code> defined in the body element
      (in our case 16px if you haven't already altered it).
    </p>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Additional note</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <p>
          While we use this in our framework it would be a <em>very very very</em> terrible idea to implement it in a
          framework that does not conform to the website it is written for, because it
          <strong>limits the usability</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A way better approach is to add a margin directly to every element, instead of just every child
          element. Like we will do with the <code>blockquote</code> element <a href="#adding-color">later</a>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      While we have added margin to each element we still need to add margins to our list item to make them look decent
      and distinctive from the paragraphs and other elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The code for this would look like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
li {
  margin-left: 2rem;
}
</pre>
    <h3>Adding responsiveness</h3>
    <p>
      If we now would add an image or make the width of our screen we still would have some problems with
      responsiveness, especially with the <code>img</code> and <code>pre</code> elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the <code>img</code> we simply add a width to it. So the code looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
img {
  width: 100%;
}
</pre>
    <p>
      For the <code>pre</code> element we have multiple options, but I personally prefer to do it like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
pre {
  overflow: auto;
}
</pre>
    <p>
      This will add an scrollbar at the buttom of the <code>pre</code> element if if the text overflows. As an
      alternative you could aslo use <code>white-space: pre-wrap;</code>, but I tend to avoid it, as it creates in my
      opinion a very unpleasent text to read as it wraps around to the start of the line and this can become especially
      distracting if some programming language code text is in the element.
    </p>
    <h3>The last stretch</h3>
    <p>
      While we are nearly done, we still have at least some elements missing. We first start with the
      <code>blockquote</code>, <code>code</code> and the <code>pre</code> elements. We try to make them visually
      distinctive from all the current elements we have.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is done with this code:
    </p>
    <pre>
pre, blockquote {
  padding: 1rem;
}

code {
  border-radius: 5px;
  padding: 0.25rem;
}
</pre>
    <p>
      Just adding the padding helps insanely! It they do not look like a normal paragraph anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further we change the <code>a</code> element up, so it does not follow the devices style anymore. And this is
      achievable with the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>
a {
  font-weight: 500;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-bottom: 1px dotted;
}

a:hover {
  border-bottom: 1px solid;
}
</pre>
    <p>
      While the change of the border might trip up some of you, I believe that it is an good alternative to changing the
      color when the <code>a</code> element is hovered, or just making the link not visually change when hovered over.
      It is, for me, the perfect mix, not to visually stunning, not to visually overloading.
    </p>
    <h2 id="adding-color">Adding Color</h2>
    <p>
      We now have come to the best part of the whole framework. Adding all the color we want! But because we still want
      to achieve a very small frameworkm that also is minimalistic, we only add four colors, one for the background, one
      for the foreground, one as an accent color and one for showing elevation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first start with the <code>:root</code> and the media query:
    </p>
    <pre>
:root {
  --fg: #121212;
  --bg: #fdfdfd;
  --accent: #fed330;
  --el: #00000010;
}
  
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --fg: #fdfdfd;
    --bg: #121212;
    --accent: #fed330;
    --el: #ffffff10;
  }
}
</pre>
    <p>
      We add four variables, <code>fg</code> for the foreground and <code>bg</code> for the background,
      <code>accent</code> as an accent color for some elements and last an transparent color <code>el</code> to visually
      represent elevation. They change depending on which color scheme the device is preferring.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is not enought to make the color scheme apply itself, so we add this to <code>body</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>
  background-color: var(--bg);
  color: var(--fg);
</pre>
    <p>
      This two lines will apply the colors correctly to the whole website.
    </p>
    <p>Furthermore we still need to add the elevation color to the <code>code</code>, <code>pre</code> and
      <code>blockquote</code> elements. This is done through the following lines:
    </p>
    <pre>
code, pre, blockquote {
  background-color: var(--el);
}</pre>
    <p>
      But we can do even more and add a border to the <code>blockquote</code> to make it even more distinctive from
      other elements, by adding a small border to its left with the following code:
    </p>
    <pre>
blockquote {
  border-left: var(--accent) 2px solid;
}
</pre>
    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      This was it. That is all you need to do to create an small, minimal (and barely usable) framework.
      I hope this more or less long guide might have helped you further understanding CSS, as
      it helped me when writing this article. Below I will add some more Ideas and References.

    <h3>What you can add</h3>
    <p>
      There are multiple things you can start adding. I will describe <em>some</em> ideas below:
    </p>
    <h4>Headers</h4>
    <p>
      While we have styled our <code>header</code> elements a little bit, we change the font size. This should be done
      with a certain typographic scale (<a href="https://spencermortensen.com/articles/typographic-scale/">here</a> a
      general article about it and <a href="https://designcode.io/typographic-scales">here</a> another one).
    </p>
    <h4>Another font</h4>
    <p>
      While we changed the font size of the headings to a costume one, we also can change the font to create an even
      stronger visual distinctiion between <em>normal</em> text and <strong>heading</strong>.
    </p>
    <h4>More color</h4>
    <p>
      And as if we aren't crazy enought, we can add more color into the design, like a gradient on certain text or on
      the background, the ideas are <strong>infinite</strong>. And I <em>emphasise</em> that you should
      <strong>go crazy</strong> on certain ideas and try them out. Try them out and look how they feel and use them if
      you like them!
    </p>
    <h4>Add shadow</h4>
    <p>
      While we made the headers visually distinctive, we could also do the same and add an shadow to the
      <code>img</code> element. But <em>you should know</em> that depending on the color scheme the visitor uses, the
      shadow must change too and shadows are a little bit complicated on dark modes.
