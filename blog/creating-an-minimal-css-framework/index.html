    <h1>Creating an minimal CSS framework</h1>

        I assume you as the reader came to this website to create your own minimal CSS, so I will show you how and what
        to do. I expect that you have a certain basic understanding of CSS and are able to look up concepts you do not
        understand.

    <h2 id="project-plan">Project Plan</h2>
    <p>
      The project plan is to create an minimal CSS framework. For that we firstly create an reset, then normalize some
      elements and then add our own style over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To let our framework be as minimal as possible, we will not add classes and id's (besides that using id's for
      frameworks is not an great idea), and we will stay with and simple classsless framework (a framework that only
      uses semantic html without adding classes).
    </p>
    <p>
      We will mainly focus on following classes to make the framework fairly simple and small:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>:root</li>
      <li>*</li>
      <li>body</li>
      <li>main</li>
      <li>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6</li>
      <li>p, li</li>
      <li>ol, ul</li>
      <li>a</li>
      <li>code</li>
      <li>pre, block</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because this limited set of featured elements will not be enough for most framework I will leave further
      extensions to the reader. Additionally I will give you furter ressources that might help adding or doing things in
      a complete different way than I have done.
    </p>
    <h2 id="css-reset">CSS Reset</h2>
    <h3>A very basic implementation</h3>
    <p>
      The most important thing to make when creating a new CSS framework is to reset the browsers default CSS settings.
      There are multiple ways to do this, but my personal preference is:
    </p>
    <pre>
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Aditional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Why do we do this exactly?</h4>
        <p>
          There are multiple reasons but the main reason is that most browsers have
          default CSS style that adds an margin on the <code>body</code> element.<br>
          The most important part is the <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>. The reason is that it will ensure a good
          consistency and predictability for the sizing of elements. Mainly because a border will stay
          in the width and height of an element (see
          <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing">Mozilla Web Docs</a>).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      This reset is very minimal, but has quite a big of problems, that we can fix later or we use a very similar
      approach that does not add styling to elements that we do not want to have changed.</p>
    <h3>An alternative minimal approach</h3>
    <pre>
html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ol, li {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Aditional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Why is this approach better?</h4>
        <p>
          Again there are multiple reasons for it, but the most important is that the <code>*</code> selector selects
          every element in a website. So our second implementation only selects the elements we want to select to not
          cause issues later.
        </p>
        <h4>Further Tips:</h4>
        <p>
          We could remove the <code>ul</code> and <code>ol</code> selectors if we want
          to keep the default padding for the lists.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      This approach is less extreme but gives most of the benifits of the first version without adding as many
      drawbacks.
    </p>
    <h2 id="normalizing">Normalizing</h2>
    <p>
      While normalizing and reseting the default are generally understood to be the same thing, I do prefer to
      differentiate between these two. That is because I understand the reset to encapsulate multiple different or as in
      our first implementation all elements of a webpage that do not directly share a different function, for example an
      paragraph (<code>p</code>) and an image (<code>img</code>).
    </p>
    <h3>Dark and Light mode</h3>
    <p>
      But before we can style furter we need to go on a small tangent on light and dark mode, espacially as css has
      features to change the mode depending on the settings of the device you use to visit a website.
    </p>
    <p>This would look like:</p>
    <pre>
:root {
  color-scheme: light;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
}
</pre>
    <p>
      This code will use the default light and dark mode style. It is a very small hack for now but we will change it
      <a href="">later</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Font and Body</h3>
    <p>
      So lets start to add our minimal styling with the <code>body</code> tag:
    </p>
    <pre>
body {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: min(65ch, 90%);
}</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Aditional notes</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Another font-family</h4>
        <p>
          While we use a very very long font-family selection . This will absolutely guarantee that a sans-serif font
          will be rendered, prefereably the font the device, that is visiting our website, is using.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      This ensures the size of the font is the same on every browser we use, prefereably the font of the system, while
      also guaranteeing that if the sytem-ui is not given there exist an fallback, ending with
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif">sans-serif</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore it centers everything in the <code>body</code> element and gives the body a certain width that is
      fixed to <em>65 characters</em> on devices with a large width and to <em>90%</em> on devices with a width
      that is smaller than the <em>65 characters</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally everything will now be centered in the middle of the website using our framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now lets continue with font settings:
    </p>
    <pre>
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  text-wrap: balance;
}

p, li {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}</pre>
    <details class="blogpost__detail">
      <summary>Aditional notes.</summary>
      <blockquote class="blogpost__tip">
        <h4>Problems with <code>balance</code> and <code>pretty</code>.</h4>
        <p>
          balance and pretty have both the problem of being computably expansive. Balance has therefor a limit of 5 or
          10
          lines, depending on the browser the device is using (see
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap">Mozilla Web Doc</a>).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </details>
    <p>
      Sadly because <code>text-wrap</code> is fairly new, not all browsers support it.
      No the less it is still very helpful to have them, as they help your text to look decent. This means that there
      will be <strong>no orphaned word</strong> (one word in the last wrapped around line of an paragarph) with
      <em>pretty</em> and that with <em>balance</em> the text <strong>looks uniform</strong>
      when it wraps over multiple lines.
